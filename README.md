## Project Overview

**Scouting-Expert** is a Sports Entertainment Platform that allows users to gain exceptional insight on current NBA prospects. Once users create an account they are granted access to view various big boards where our basketball pundits rank and critigue top players within a specific draft class. Big board and player creation is currently limited to admin but in later versions of this application, users will be able to comment on rankings and critiques, as well as create thier own big boards and prospects.
